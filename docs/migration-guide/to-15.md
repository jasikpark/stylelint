# Migrating to 15.0.0

## Change of `overrides.extends` behaviour

The `overrides.extends` behaviour was changed to be merged not replaced, to make it consistency with the `overrides.plugins`. 

If you would like to keep the previous behavior, you should change your config to:

```diff json
{
- "extends": ["config-a"]
  "overrides": [
    {
      "rules": ["*.module.css"],
      "extends": ["config-b"]
    },
+   {
+     "rules": ["*.css"],
+     "extends": ["config-a"]
+   },
  ]
}
```
